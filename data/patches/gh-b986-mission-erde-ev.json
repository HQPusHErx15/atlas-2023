{"id":-1,"name":"Mission Erde e.V.","description":"Just like our name says, we have a big & challenging mission: Together we protect, preserve and fight for our earth.\n\nTogether is the most important keyword. Together with Robert Marc Lehmann we, the founding members of Mission Erde e.V.: Kirsten A., Robert A., Tina V., Birgit G., Sebastian U. and Julia L., would like to help with know-how and Man(&Woman)power to preserve habitats, to realize missions of Robert and to sensitize the population for the protection of wild animals and the responsible handling of nature.\n\nWith our activities at home and abroad we contribute to make our world a little bit better and greener. This association is a way for us and others not only to fund projects, but also to expand them in order to reach as many people as possible and make as much of a difference as possible.","links":{"website":["https://missionerde.de/"],"discord":["KUzT8jUuQb"]},"path":{"158-166":[[44,-986],[46,-986],[47,-986],[47,-987],[50,-987],[51,-987],[51,-988],[55,-988],[55,-989],[59,-989],[59,-990],[63,-990],[63,-991],[67,-991],[67,-992],[71,-992],[71,-993],[75,-993],[75,-992],[79,-992],[79,-991],[83,-991],[83,-990],[87,-990],[87,-989],[91,-989],[91,-988],[95,-988],[95,-987],[99,-987],[99,-986],[102,-986],[102,-982],[101,-982],[101,-973],[100,-973],[100,-967],[99,-967],[99,-959],[98,-959],[98,-952],[97,-952],[97,-944],[96,-944],[96,-939],[95,-939],[95,-937],[94,-937],[94,-935],[93,-935],[93,-934],[92,-934],[92,-933],[91,-933],[91,-932],[90,-932],[90,-932],[90,-931],[89,-931],[89,-930],[87,-930],[87,-929],[85,-929],[85,-928],[81,-928],[65,-927],[65,-928],[61,-928],[61,-929],[59,-929],[59,-930],[57,-930],[57,-931],[56,-931],[56,-932],[55,-932],[55,-933],[54,-933],[54,-934],[53,-934],[53,-935],[52,-935],[52,-937],[51,-937],[51,-939],[50,-939],[50,-944],[49,-944],[49,-952],[48,-952],[48,-960],[47,-960],[47,-967],[46,-967],[46,-974],[45,-974],[45,-983],[44,-983],[44,-986]]},"center":{"158-166":[73,-966]}}
